            We are an online marketplace that empowers entrepreneurs to build a sustainable business based on repeat customers. Our product is built by entrepreneurs, for entrepreneurs -- we understand what it means to be too busy to sweat the small stuff. We aim to remove the technical expertise needed to build a profitable online business, making the joys of entrepreneurship accessible for all.

            Experience has proven to us that listening to our sellers' feedback is the best opportunity we have to consistently improve our product. That's why we've developed various tools over the years to make online selling easy. Our business relies on making successful sellers, so it's not a coincidence that the tools we offer can be customized to fit our sellers' needs.
            
            Some of our most popular tools include:
            
            Automatic eBay, Amazon, and Shopify inventory import/sync
            Multi-item editing capabilities
            Customized marketing campaign tools
            Zero-effort webstores (automatically built from your marketplace account)
            Bonanza has been a seller-centric marketplace since our inception - that's why we don't make any money until you do. No listing fees, no monthly store fees, no other sneaky fees. We provide one-click publishing to all major buyer channels, and we pay all advertising costs on your behalf until you make a sale.
            
            Although most marketplaces focus exclusively on promoting their own brand to buyers, Bonanza is a platform that allows sellers to make sales and build a brand by developing relationships with their customers. Building your online business takes vision, dedication, and time, so you need to know you're building on a solid foundation.
            
            In 2021, Bonanza was ranked first for "Customer Service", "Communication" and "Most Recommended Marketplace" in the EcommerceBytes Sellers Choice Awards, ahead of eBay, Amazon, Etsy, and all other contenders in the largest online survey of sellers, administered by the longest running ecommerce industry news sites, Ecommercebytes. In 2020, we were voted best "Customer Service", "Communication" and "Ease of Use."

            Bonanza Management
            Bill Harding Headshot
            Bill Harding
            CEO and Founder
            Bill started building Bonanza in 2007 after becoming frustrated during a rainy garage sale in Seattle. Possessing of virtually zero skills in web development, Bill recognized that he needed to quit his day job, learn how to program websites, and defeat Craigslist. Only then would he never stand in the rain regretting another miserable garage sale.
            
            His target proved more formidable than he had anticipated.
            
            But after launching to crickets in mid-2008, Bill caught a break when Bonanza was declared "The Best eBay Alternative We've Seen" by Ecommerce Guide. Within months, Bonanza grew from "Bill's mom and her friend" to a few thousand sellers. From there, it grew to a marketplace that now offers more than 10 million items for sale to most every country in the world.
            
            Bill is inspired by listening, simplicity, and getting things done. He enjoys basketball, traveling, assimilating new music, and writing in the third person.
            
            Prior to creating Bonanza, Bill worked as a Lead Developer at Amaze Entertainment. He graduated the University of Washington with a BS in Computer Software Systems and Mathematics.

            Greg Braukus
            Vice President
            Greg joined Bonanza in 2020 wanting to go back to his Seattle roots in a start-up environment - leveraging his 20+ years of experience in Customer Service, Operational Excellence and eCommerce. He is inspired by simplicity, efficiency, and passionate customers. Greg enjoys spending time with his family, Seattle sports, and volunteering to coach his children’s athletic teams. Prior to Bonanza, Greg worked as the Director of Enterprise eCommerce at Terex Corporation. He also held several leadership positions in Operations and Customer Service at Amazon.com and Microsoft. Greg graduated from the University of Washington with a BA in Political Science.
